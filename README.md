# Google-Playstore

Invistigation of the Google dataset.

The aim of this prototype to take a prophylactic approach and improve the revenue of undervalued Google's apps to motivate the developers to keep working on them.

Since her department's budget for marketing won't allow her to invest on ads (which would boost the number of sales), the only way to improve the revenue is by tweaking the price. She requests that you determine which paid apps are undervalued (undervalued here means that their price could be increased without lowering demand). The prototype conducted in order to achieve:

1.Having a prototype makes it much easier to estimate the cost of a fully fleshed-out project, be it human, technological, or financial resources.

2.Having a more accurate estimate of the cost allows decision-makers to not go through with the project if it doesn't seem profitable enough, or not the best allocation of resources at that point in time.

3.It allows grunt workers (like ourselves) to change and add missing requirements to complete the project. Oftentimes these are overlooked and only spotted later; some examples are missing data, the creation of a new database, the development of an API.

4.It allows business people (like the account manager) to tweak the project's goal.

5.It gives all stakeholders an opportunity to add easily accomplishable side-goals given the main goal, thus maximizing the project's output
